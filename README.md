## Automatically fills the ID field in the OpenU login page

### Description

To log into the Open University of Israel (OpenU, for short) website a student must fill three fields: Username, password, ID number. While the first two fields can be filled automatically by the browser, the ID field must always be filled manually which is an inconvenience. This repository offers an extension for chromium-based browsers that automatically fills that field with a specified ID number.
